Week time scale
	- Longpress on bar to add a node, longpress on node to remove it.
	- We place a node at 00:00 that says 'Night to Day' or 'Day to Night' (circumventing vagueness of assignment description)
	- We have at most five changes from 'Night to Day' and vice versa
	- When dragging a node, you see the exact time in a popup window above the node. This popup window drags along with the node.
